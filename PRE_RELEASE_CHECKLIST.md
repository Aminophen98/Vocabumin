## ⚠️ Still TODO Before Publishing

### 1. Create Extension Icons (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Status**: ❌ Not done

**What to do**:
- Create icons: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128 pixels
- Place in `/extension/icons/` folder
- See [docs/ICONS_NEEDED.md](docs/ICONS_NEEDED.md) for detailed instructions

**Why it's important**:
- Extension will show placeholder icon without them
- Unprofessional appearance
- Required for Chrome Web Store

**Time estimate**: 1-2 hours

---

### 2. Test Extension Thoroughly (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Status**: ❌ Not done

**What to do**:
Use [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) as a guide. Specifically test:

- [ ] Installation process (fresh install)
- [ ] At least 10 different YouTube videos
- [ ] Videos with auto-generated captions
- [ ] Videos with manual captions
- [ ] Videos without captions (error handling)
- [ ] Cache functionality (watch same video twice)
- [ ] Video switching behavior
- [ ] Multiple tabs with YouTube
- [ ] Playback at different speeds (0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, 2x)
- [ ] Browser refresh while video playing

**Why it's important**:
- Find bugs before users do

**Time estimate**: 2-4 hours
